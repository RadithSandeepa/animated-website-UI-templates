<a id="Bugs-to-Fix"></a>
## Bugs to Fix

- Entering '=' First: Currently, the calculator allows users to input the '=' operator as the first character, leading to unexpected behavior. This should be prevented to ensure proper calculation flow.
- Adding Numbers After Infinity: When the result of a calculation is 'Infinity', users can still add numbers to the display, which should be disabled to prevent further calculations.

<a id="Potential-Improvements"></a>
## Potential Improvements

- History Feature: Add a history feature to track previous calculations, allowing users to review and reuse past results.
- Customization Options: Provide users with options to customize the calculator's appearance and functionality, such as theme selection or additional mathematical functions.
